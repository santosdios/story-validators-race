# Story Front Chain Dashboard
## the first modular front-end dashboard for Story nodes! 🎉  

[https://story.frontchain.cumulo.pro/](https://story.frontchain.cumulo.pro/)  


The Story Front Chain Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to monitor, verify, and test the status of the chain and nodes in the Story network, while also providing direct access to dApps within the ecosystem.

### Key Features:  

#### 📊 Metrics  
View key network metrics for Story, including data such as the number of transactions, block size, consensus height, block processing time, and more. These metrics enable real-time monitoring of network performance.  

#### 🟢 Node Status  
Check the status of nodes connected to the network. Get insights on the number of synchronized blocks, the current block height, and the RPC connection status. This section helps ensure the node is running smoothly.  

#### 📚 Validators Resources  
Access the Validators Resources section to find valuable tools and documentation specifically for Story validators. This includes configuration guides, network parameters, and best practices to ensure effective validator operations. Validators can use these resources to maintain optimal performance and stay up-to-date with the latest updates in the Story network.  

🔄 Note: We will continuously update these resources throughout the development of the testnet to ensure validators have the most accurate and relevant information available.

#### 🔧 Test RPC  
Test and validate the connection to Story node RPC endpoints. This feature is essential for verifying that the RPC node is responding correctly and processing requests.  

#### 🛠️ Test EVM-RPC  
Test specific EVM-RPC endpoints for interacting with smart contracts and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functionalities on Story. Ensure that EVM contract interactions are processed properly.  

#### 🌐 Test Cosmos-WebSocket  
Validate WebSocket connections on the Cosmos-based Story network, allowing subscriptions to real-time events such as new block arrivals or transaction validations. Useful for developers needing to track live changes on the blockchain.  

#### ⚡ Test EVM-WebSocket  
Test WebSocket connections specifically for the EVM network, providing real-time data on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) events. This functionality is critical for decentralized applications that depend on instant event notifications. Test EVM WebSocket connections with WebSocket Proxy using Node.js ([+ info](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Cumulo-Front-Chain/blob/main/webSocket/ProxyWebSocket.md))

#### 🖥️ dApps  
Access deployed dApps on the Story network directly from the dashboard. Explore and interact with decentralized applications built on the Story Front Chain.  

### 🚀 Dashboard Highlights:   
  - Built with HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript for a fast, smooth user experience without complex back-end systems. ⚡  
  - Real-time monitoring of node synchronization, block height, gas usage, and transaction efficiency for complete node management. 📊  
  - Continuous monitoring of critical endpoints (RPC, EVM-RPC, Websocket) to ensure service health and quick response to issues. 🟢🔴  
  - Optimized performance with automatic live updates, no manual refresh needed. 🔄
